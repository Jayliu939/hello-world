					<h1>Detailed explainations:</h1>
					<h1>About me</h1>
						<p>
						  From young, I have always been interested in the workings of our world, having been brought up on channels<br>
						  like National Geographic; This has led to me being deeply passionate in the STEM field. Besides STEM, I also<br>
						  recently took up photography to see our world in a different light. I aspire to get a degree in mechanical <br>
						  engineering in University and hope to land a job in the Singaporean Defense Industry.<br>
						</p>
					<h1>Experiences</h1>
					<h3>NUS research attachment</h3>
					<h4>What it was about</h4>
					<p>
						This year-long research attachment involved me and two other classmates, where we were tasked with heating fish scales <br>
						and recording the effects of the heat, in order to make them adsorb oil so that they can be used in kitchen sinks<br>
						to collect oil and turn them into biofuel. The principle behind this was that the collagen in fish scales would expand during heating,<br>
						allowing oil to be adsorbed. In order to carry out this goal, we first characterised the fishscales by<br>
						exposing them to various types of light then noting the fluorescence, as well as analysing them using FTIR. I personally was also<br>
						responsible for the design of a prototype water filter to put in our treated fish scales to prove our hypothesis. Before then,  <br>
						I also had to simulate water flow through the filter to ensure maximum adsorption took place.<br>
					</p>
					<h4>My takeaways from this experience</h4>
					<p>
						Frankly, the result was quite disappointing - we did not manage to get into the SSEF finals. However, I still felt that<br>
						the experience was undoubtedly one of the best I ever had; Few ever got to be in a real university lab in secondary school,<br>
						much less get to conduct their own scientific investigation and write a paper. This experience definitely reinforced my<br>
						mental fortitude as it was very draining to get through all the failures and the challenge of balancing school work with<br>
						the mountains of reference papers we had to read through.<br>

					<h2>Science Buskers</h2>
					<p>
						Science Buskers is a competition organised by Science Center in which competitors try to explain scientific concepts<br>
						in a way that people of all backgrounds could understand. My team, composed of one classmate in our first attempt and <br>
						with two in our second attempt. In our first attempt, our demonstration was showing how purple cabbage juice acted like a indicator.<br>
						However, the project was quite rushed as many of our previous attempts involving different experiments did not succeed, meaning that<br>
						we did not have enough time to practice our script. <br>
						<br>
						For our next year, the demonstration we choose was the iodine clock experiment. Although I felt that our preperation was sufficient this<br>
						time around, I thought our presentation skills could still be improved as we occasionally stuttered and forgot a few lines.<br>
						Despite this, I felt that I had learnt alot from these two events as I learnt more about the importance of being well-prepared<br>
						especially when it came to presentation. It also taught me to perservere in the face of adversity as we faced many challenges
						during both attempts.<br>

					<h2>Overseas STEM journey to Osaka</h2>
					<p>
						During the December Holidays last year, I was fortunate enough to be on the school-organised trip to Osaka Japan where we would<br>
						experience and learn about Japanese culture and visit their schools, specifically Sagano High school. The trip was quite the eye-opener<br>
						as the Japanese schools were much more modern as compared to Singaporean schools, with better facilities. Furthermore, the Japanese<br>
						people were very polite to an extent that was very shocking to me.

					<h2>BuildingBloCS June Conference</h2>
					<p>
						BuildingBloCS is an event organised by youth in which they teach others about computing, mostly AI-oriented. As a participant, I chose<br>
						the "intermediate" difficulty. Throughout the experience, which lasted two days, I learnt about various emerging AI technologies, as well<br>
						as how to code a website using entirely Python through the library Streamlit; I also learnt how to make various algorithims and<br>
						neural networks, all of which will be extremely usefull in finding trends, especially when analysing scientific data. I found the <br>
						course to be quite challenging, even for the intermediate route, especially during the AI segments as I was not familiar with the <br>
						terminology and concepts taught. However, in the end, I found the experience to be very enjoyable and helpful.<br>

					<h2>My role in NCC</h2>
					<p>
						Aeromodelling is a division of NCC which is unique to air branches. In aeromodelling, cadets get to build wooden gliders<br>
						and fly drones. As the head of Aeromodelling, I was responsible for the planning and execution of aeromod sessions.<br>
						This includes writing the timeplan (which is a timeline of events that will happen in the session, as well as the<br>
						responsiblities/roles of supporting personnel and the logistics required. Not only that, whenever the Excos were unable<br>
						to turn up for CCA, I would take over their responsiblities of ensuring the training went smoothly.<br>
					</p>
					<h2>Qualities and experiences I have gained from NCC</h2>
					<p>
						As an aeromodelling head, I have gained a wealth of knowledge from NCC. Most prominent of which was learning to be more adaptible.<br>
						One of the more memoriable incidences that took place was when our original training location was notified to us to be off-limits<br>
						just 10 minutes before the session started, and almost all of the 4 teachers in charge were unavailable. In this situation, <br>
						I improvised by getting another venue. Since the new venue was 3x smaller than the original one, I also had to <br>
						reorganise the entire training plan on the spot. After 20 minutes running from venue to venue, breifing the <br>
						other cadet leaders on the new arrangements, I finally managed to get the session on track. In the end, everything went <br>
						smoothly afterwards and we even finished ahead of schedule.<br>
						I graduated from that year's NCC batch as the only Staff-Sergeant, just one rank below exco.<br>
					</p>
				</div>
				
				<div>
					<h1>My qualities</h1>
					<h2>Adaptivity</h2>
						<p>Improvisation is one of my greatest strengths, whether it be public speaking, adjusting a CCA training plan halfway through or<br>
						having to deal with lesser resources. No matter how unprepared I may be, I am ready to stand up to and overcome any scenarios that<br>
						may take place during a project or any other activities I take part in.</p>
					<h2>Enthusiasm</h2>
						<p>Always ready to try new things with zest and passion, making up lack of skill with a willing to learn quickly. Despite not <br>
						taking biology, I went along with a mainly biology-based project for the NUS mentorship project without any complaints and even a curiosity<br>
						of what I could learn.</p>
					<h2>Resilience & grit</h2>
						<p>With the massive workload brought about by the number of commitments I took on, I had to endure through the stress while still being<br>
						able to keep up with all the assignments I had. Furthermore, not only do I endure, I actually perform better under stress as I get a motivator<br>
						to finish the task at hand faster.</p>

# hello-world
Public repository for displaying some of my work

If it seems that my github is quite small, most of my repositories are privated and old. Many of my files I am unable to find.

However, I have included the HTML and CSS to my website (which has an expired domain name). The website is partially broken if you try to open it as github does not allow me to upload the photos.
Along with other minor projects and practices I have found.
